### 💻 Lab 5 - Generate a utility lib

###### ⏰ Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

Let's fix the ratings! They don't look that good and they could benefit from some formatting.

We will create a shared utility lib where we'll add our formatters and see how to import them in our components afterwards.

#### 📚 Learning outcomes:

- Get familiar with generating project specific, framework agnostic utility libs

#### 🏋️‍♀️ Steps:

1. Stop the `nx serve`
2. Use the `@nrwl/workspace` package to generate another lib in the `libs/store` folder - let's call it `util-formatters`.
3. Add the [code for the utility function](../../examples/lab5/libs/store/util-formatters/src/lib/store-util-formatters.ts) to the new library you just created `libs/store/util-formatters/src/lib/store-util-formatters.ts`
4. Use it in your frontend project to format the rating for each game

   `app.component.ts`:

   ```ts
   import { formatRating } from '@bg-hoard/store/util-formatters';

   export class AppComponent {
     //...
     formatRating = formatRating;
   }
   ```

   `app.component.html`:

   ```html
   {{ formatRating(game.rating) }}
   ```

    </details>

5. Serve the store app - notice how the ratings are formatted.
6. Launch the dependency graph - notice how the app depends on two libs now.
7. Inspect what changed from the last time you committed, then commit your changes
